## Project

1.  Used HTML, JavaScript and Tailwind for building this project.
2.  Deployed using Vercel.com.
3.  One of the initial challenge was to route the pages. This was my first time to do routing in HTML. What I done for routing is linked the HTML components in `<a>`
4.  To ensure responsiveness across various devices, Tailwind CSS was utilized. This decision significantly aided in the creation of responsive designs.
5.  The design inspiration was drawn from two sources: mocdoc.in and flowbite.com.
